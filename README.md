# Free Band Summer Project 2020

This repo is a collection of notes and prototypes for the 2020 summer project 
focused on implementing efficient algorithms for the word problem in free bands

## Goals

- [x] Read section 4.5 of Howie's book *"Fundamentals of Semigroup Theory"*
- [x] Understand the paper *"Efficient Testing of Equivalence of Words 
in a Free Idempotent Semigroup"* by Jakub Radoszewski and Wojciech Rytter
  - [x] Produce interval automaton (Fig 1. in paper)
  - [x] Explain this to James
- [ ] Implement the algorithm
  - [ ] Prototype in python
  - [ ] Implement in GAP for tests
    - [x] Implement Right
    - [ ] Implement LevelEdges
    - [x] Implement RadixSort
  - [ ] Implement in C++ for libsemigroups
